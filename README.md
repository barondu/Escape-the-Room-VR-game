# "Escape the Room" VR game 

Our team built an immersive "Escape the Room" VR game with a virtual environment.

Escape Room games are a popular genre of game on smartphones and in the real world. Typically, a person needs to explore a room, pick up objects, manipulate or combine objects and solve puzzles.

The emphasis of this project is for the user to focus on manipulation of objects (drawers and doors that open, furniture that can be moved, etc.) and 3D interaction (e.g. picking up objects to use them, sliding objects in puzzles). User will explore the room from a first-person perspective.
